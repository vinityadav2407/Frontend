            <h1 class="about">Jungle life of tiger and lion</h1>
            <p class="aboutjungle"> In the dense jungle, a rare coexistence unfolds between the tiger and the lion. The tiger, with its striped orange coat, moves stealthily through the underbrush, while the lion, with its golden mane, prefers the open glades. Although both are apex predators, they respect each other's territories and avoid conflict.

                Tigers are solitary hunters, relying on stealth to ambush prey like deer and wild boar. Lions, however, form prides that work together to hunt larger animals. Occasionally, their territories overlap, leading to tense encounters, but these are rare. The jungle's abundance of prey ensures minimal competition.
                
                Near waterholes, the lion's commanding roar echoes, while the tiger's growl marks its solitary claim. Despite their differences, both species maintain ecological balance by controlling herbivore populations. Scavengers benefit from their kills, contributing to the jungle's cycle of life.
                
                During the heat of the day, tigers cool off in streams, while lions rest in shaded areas. Both species nurture their young, with tiger mothers teaching cubs the art of hunting, and lionesses demonstrating cooperative survival.
                
                As night falls, the jungle comes alive with distant roars and growls. Though they are competitors, their existence symbolizes the delicate harmony of nature. The lion and the tiger, majestic and powerful, embody the resilience and beauty of the wilderness, maintaining the vibrant pulse of the jungle.</p>
